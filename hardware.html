                            testTo facilitate the delivery of the fluid produced by our wet lab
                        team as a potential therapeutic for alleviating hay fever
                        symptoms, we designed a nasal spray device. Conventional
                        commercial sprays typically incorporate a metal spring mechanism,
                        which complicates recycling and often results in disposal as
                        landfill waste. In contrast, our prototype is fully 3D-printed
                        using recyclable plastics, eliminating the need for metal
                        components. To replace the spring, we implemented a manual
                        pull-back piston mechanism, which allows the user to prime the
                        device before spraying. This design maintains functionality while
                        simplifying both manufacturing and recyclability. Additionally,
                        the device features modular, replaceable parts, ensuring that
                        individual components can be substituted in the event of damage or
                        fluid depletion. This approach extends the device's lifespan and
                        reduces both cost and environmental impact compared to purchasing
                        an entirely new spray unit.

                            The final prototype consists of six major components: the cover,
                        case, upper receiver, lower receiver, lower receiver cap, and
                        cartridge.

                    <p>
                        The nasal spray is composed of three primary components: the
                        cartridge, the lower receiver (housing for the pumping mechanism),
                        and the upper receiver (housing for the nozzle and cartridge
                        interface). Multiple variants of each part were designed to
                        enhance modularity and adaptability. In addition, we incorporated
                        a replaceable hygienic nozzle cover, which improves sanitation
                        during repeated use and reduces the risk of cross-contamination
                        when the device is shared.
                    </p>
                    <div id="cartridge">
                        <h3>Cartridge</h3>
                        <p>
                            The cartridge functions as the fluid reservoir of the nasal spray
                            and is designed to hold water or other non-corrosive liquids. As
                            the cartridge is 3D-printed, print quality directly affects its
                            performance. Poor slicer settings or insufficient wall thickness
                            can lead to leakage. To ensure structural integrity and prevent
                            fluid loss, we recommend using at least three wall layers or 100%
                            infill with concentric infill patterns. A minimum wall thickness
                            of 1.5 mm provides additional resistance against accidental drops.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Printing should be carried out at a reduced speed to minimize
                            inconsistencies caused by filament variability or temperature
                            fluctuations. Printing slowly also improves the quality of
                            overhangs in threaded regions, reducing sagging and ensuring that
                            the screw connections form accurately.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="lowerRec">
                        <h3>Lower Receiver</h3>
                        <p>
                            The lower receiver contains several critical components, including
                            the dip tube, check valve, and piston cylinder. If reprinting is
                            required and the check valve ball needs to be recovered, it can be
                            removed by carefully cutting away the surrounding plastic. A hot
                            knife or soldering iron can be used to remove the outer wall,
                            followed by opening the internal cage with a small knife to
                            release the ball. Caution should be taken when using a hot knife
                            for the entire process, as molten plastic can adhere to the ball
                            surface and affect its smoothness.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Regarding the threaded regions, it is important that the thread be
                            modeled and printed as a continuous feature along its full length.
                            Starting a thread mid-surface often results in bridging errors and
                            failed prints (see Figure 3.1 and 3.2 for a comparison of correct
                            and incorrect thread geometries). To avoid excessive support
                            material, we recommend printing the lower receiver in an inverted
                            orientation, which eliminates the need for supporting the bottom
                            rim (see Figure 4).

                        <h3>Upper Receiver</h3>
                        <p>
                            The upper receiver primarily consists of the piston head and
                            nozzle, with the addition of a removable protective cap to
                            maintain hygiene during use.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When printing the piston head, it is advisable to prepare multiple
                            size variations to ensure a proper fit. Because TPU tends to
                            compress slightly during extrusion, printed parts often result in
                            dimensions that are larger than expected. This effect also
                            complicates the precise sizing of the liquid guide tubing leading
                            to the nozzle tip. To address this, we designed the piston head to
                            accommodate both larger and smaller tubing diameters. By default,
                            the design is modeled for a thicker guide tube; if a thinner tube
                            is required, the wall thickness can be adjusted accordingly (see
                            Figure 5.1 and 5.2).

                            The nozzle itself incorporates an internal mixing feature. While
                            fine geometries such as a swirl chamber composed of multiple
                            micro-channels are impractical to fabricate with FDM printing, we
                            implemented a screw-shaped insert to induce a vortex. This modular
                            design allows additional inserts to be stacked, enabling
                            adjustment of the vortex strength as needed (see Figure 6.1 and
                            6.2).

                    <h2>Limitations and Future Improvements</h2>
                    <p>
                        While our prototype successfully demonstrated the feasibility of a
                        fully 3D-printed, springless nasal spray, several limitations
                        remain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First, the use of FDM printing introduced dimensional
                        inaccuracies, particularly in fine features such as threading and
                        internal channels. These inaccuracies occasionally caused leakage
                        or poor component fit. Resin-based printing would allow for far
                        greater precision in these areas. However, conventional resins are
                        toxic in their uncured state, require careful post-processing with
                        solvents such as isopropyl alcohol, and often produce brittle
                        parts. If resin printing is pursued in the future, it will be
                        necessary to employ certified biocompatible resins (such as those
                        used in medical or dental applications) to ensure safety and
                        stability when in contact with biological fluids. Although these
                        materials are more expensive and demanding to process, they would
                        allow higher accuracy while maintaining safety standards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Second, while our modular design enabled flexibility, our
                        evaluation of ergonomics was limited. More targeted surveys—for
                        example, on preferred handle shapes, grip styles, or nozzle
                        ergonomics—could provide valuable insights to guide future design
                        iterations. Incorporating user feedback at this level would
                        improve both comfort and accessibility of the device.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Third, we underestimated the development time required to design
                        and refine a nasal spray device. While the basic concept appears
                        simple, the precision needed for components such as check valves,
                        pistons, and nozzles made the engineering process more challenging
                        than anticipated. Allocating additional time for prototyping and
                        testing would have allowed us to optimize performance further and
                        evaluate a wider range of design variants.

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        Through this project, we demonstrated that it is possible to design
                        and fabricate a fully 3D-printed, springless nasal spray device that
                        is modular, recyclable, and customizable. By optimizing print
                        parameters and adapting the design for FDM limitations, we created a
                        functional prototype that balances usability, durability, and
                        environmental considerations.
